# Text Summarization with Transformers - Fine-tuning Project

This repository contains the code for a text summarization project using Hugging Face's Transformers library and PyTorch. The goal of this project is to fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model for the task of text summarization. The model will be trained on a large corpus of data and then fine-tuned on a specific dataset for the summarization task.

## Introduction

Text summarization is the task of creating a shorter version of a given text while retaining its key information. In this project, we will use Hugging Face's Transformers library, which provides access to various pre-trained transformer models like llama-2, BERT, GPT-2, and T5, for fine-tuning a summarization model. Fine-tuning is the process of training the model on a specific task using a relatively small dataset to adapt it to that task.

## Setup

To get started with the project, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can use `pip` to install them.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
Then,

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make sure you have the necessary hardware requirements (e.g., GPU) to train the models efficiently.

## Data

The data for this project should be in a format suitable for text summarization. You can use publicly available datasets or create your custom dataset. Ensure that the dataset contains text documents and their corresponding summaries.

## Preprocessing

Before fine-tuning the model, you need to preprocess the data. The preprocessing step may involve tasks like tokenization, padding, and data splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

## Fine-tuning

The fine-tuning process involves loading a pre-trained transformer model and training it on the summarization dataset. You can fine-tune the model using the `transformers` library and PyTorch. Tweak the hyperparameters and training settings based on the size of your dataset and computational resources.

## Evaluation

After fine-tuning, it's crucial to evaluate the performance of your model. Common evaluation metrics for text summarization include ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) and BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy).

## Inference

Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it for inference on new text data. Provide a script or notebook that demonstrates how to use the model to generate summaries for unseen text documents.

## Model Deployment

To deploy your model to a production environment, you can use frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to create a REST API that accepts text input and returns the corresponding summaries.

## Contributing
